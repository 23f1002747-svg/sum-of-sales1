This is a simple web application to calculate total sales from a CSV data file (`data.csv`). It uses Tailwind CSS for styling and vanilla JavaScript for functionality.

## Features

## Usage
1. Place your `data.csv` file in the same directory.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Click "Load Data" to load and display the sales data.
4. Click "Calculate Total Sales" to compute and display the total sales amount.

## Data Format
Your `data.csv` should have the following columns:

```csv
Item,Quantity,Price

Item2,5,5.00
...
```

## Notes
